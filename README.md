## Code Organization

### Models
- **User Model**: Functions to manage user data (register, login).
- **Post Model**: Functions for CRUD operations on posts.
- **Comment Model**: Functions for CRUD operations on comments.
- **Like Model**: Functions to toggle and retrieve likes.

### Controllers
- **User Controller**: Interfaces with the User model.
- **Post Controller**: Interfaces with the Post model.
- **Comment Controller**: Interfaces with the Comment model.
- **Like Controller**: Interfaces with the Like model.

### Middleware
- **Error Handler**: Custom error class for handling exceptions.
- **Authentication**: Middleware to validate and secure routes using JWT.
- **File Upload**: Middleware for managing media uploads.
- **Logger**: Middleware for logging request details.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up Express Application**:
   - Initialize a new Node.js project.
   - Configure Express.js with middleware for JSON parsing, error handling, and logging.

2. **Create Models and Controllers**:
   - Develop modular ES6 classes for User, Post, Comment, and Like operations.
   - Write corresponding controllers to handle API logic.

3. **Add Authentication**:
   - Use bcryptjs for password hashing.
   - Implement JWT for generating and validating authentication tokens.

4. **Add Middleware**:
   - Logger middleware to log request URLs and bodies.
   - File upload middleware using Multer.

5. **Build Routes**:
   - Define RESTful endpoints for user, post, comment, and like operations.
   - Secure routes using the authentication middleware.

6. **Testing and Debugging**:
   - Test routes with Postman or similar tools.
   - Use console logs and the logger middleware to debug issues.

7. **Documentation**:
   - Write comprehensive comments and update this README.

## Running the Application

1. Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```

2. Use Postman or a similar tool to test the API endpoints.

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Database Integration**:
   - Replace in-memory data structures with a database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL.

2. **Pagination**:
   - Implement pagination for posts and comments.

3. **Search and Filters**:
   - Add search and filtering options for posts.

4. **User Profiles**:
   - Enhance user profiles with additional metadata.
